# Finite state machines

- Finite state machine 
    - an abstract representation of how something changes from one state to another in response to a condition or event
    - only be one state at a time
    - changes state in response to an event or condition
    - defined by a list of tis states and the conditions for each transition

- Applications of FSMs
    - Robotics
    - Video games industry
    - Design of digital hardware systems
    - esign of compilers and network protocols
    - Definition of languages


- Create a finite state machine of your projects to represent it

# Finite state automaton

- FSM with no output
    - finite state automaton

- if automaton reaches a final state
    - accept the input


# Recognising a language

- A Finite state sytem accepts a string
