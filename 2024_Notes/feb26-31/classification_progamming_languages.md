# Low - High languages


- Low level
    - getting closer to the metal
    - closer to the hardware
    - manage memory
    - Exemples:
        - assembly, C
            - Assembly : specific to the harware, x86 intel, won't work on an AMD

- High level
    - don't do memory management
    - removing the implementation
    - Exemples:
        - python

- C can be a high and a low level language, THEREFORE is not a low level
    - it is considered low because when you compre to more high level languages, C is considered as low level.

- comapare declarative vs imperative
    - imperative
        - code directly controls execution flow and state change
        - describing the solution
        - steps and flow (control flow, if statements, else closes)
    - declarative
        - code declares properties of the desired result
        - describe the problem
            - Exemples:
                - HTML

- python interpreter is written in c++

- Interpreter : run a program to run a program
    - interpreter = a program
    - glue between high level language, low level details

- compiler
    - compile the program into machine code or assembler
