# Terminology

# Software

- Software
    - sequences of instructions which run on the hardware/computer
    - comes in form of programs

    - OS
        - Windows, android, ubuntu
        - kind of system software, must import one
        - in control of all the applications
        - security
    - Utility Programs
        - support the efficient running of a computer system
        - OS and utility programs can be installed seperately
        - usually performs maintenance, analysis, configuration, and optimisation tasks
    - Libraries
        - prewritten instructions, reused for use in other programs
        - file reading and writting
        - part of OS
    - Translators
        - convert program code from one format to another
        - compilers, interpreters (sometimes there are in-betweens)


- General purpose
    - used for variety of tasks
- Special purpose
    - used for one particular task
- Bespoke
    - meet the user's specific requirements. Custom made version of iSAM
    - specific client, only for that client

- driver software
    - GPU drivers
        - understand how to use the GPU
    - set of instructions that is expected

- Kernel
    - a piece of software that sits between the user and the hardware
    - translate user commands into machine language
    - part of an operating system

- Software categories
    - system software
        - the foundation
    - application : powerpoint, spotify
        - anything that is not vital but option

- System software
    - controls the hardware of a computer system

- BIOS
    - tells where the starting point of system software is

- Translators
    - software tools that convert source code into a format that your computer can read and execute
    - compilers, interpreters, or assemblers (specific interpreter for assembly only)

- Hardware
    - physical components of a computer

    - core
        - RAM, 
    - peripheral
        - mouse
        - keyboard

# What is a computer ?

- Type of mathematicians (human) / historically

---

# Computer Harware

- physical components of a computer system
    - Processor
    - Main memory
        - RAM = short term memory
        - Storage = long term memory
            - Memory = RAM
            - Storage = HDD, SSD
            
    - Input/Output controllers
        - part of the machine that is 
        - IO controller != IO devices

- referred as the 'three-box model'
    - linked by the system bus, has a high-speed communication channel

- system bus 
    - control, data, address
        - data = transfer data
        - control = control the flow of data
        - address = give the name of adresses
            - 'three-box model' uses the system bus to communicate between each other
