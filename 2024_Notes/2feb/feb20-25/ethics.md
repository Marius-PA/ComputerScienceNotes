    - all data in one server
        - single point
            - more vulnerable to attacks
        - security problem
- need agreement from residents to be recorded

# ethical

- may pay for the service without knowing about it

## Sentences

One of the biggest issue would be the legal aspect and the violation of privacy, video and audio footage are being recorded constantly, which leads to having whole of the patients life on video and that can be accessed at any time by anyone of the staff. Furthermore, all of the data are stored in a single server on a website, which opens dors to single point server attacks which would may give access to the footage to hackers which leads to security problems. Also, residents need to give explicit consent to be recorded.

Additionally, the patient may need to pay for this service which they are not even aware of, this may lead into confusion for certain residents who might be asking why they need to pay extra fees.
