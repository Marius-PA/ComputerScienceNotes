# What are the moral, ethical, legal and cultural aspects of Cryptocurrencies

As cryptocurrencies are very recent in the world of finance, introducing a new technology called the blockchain which has been created to increase security and trust as a decentralized network. However, because crytocurrencies are worth real money individuals might not put trust into crytpocurriens due to their extreme volatility and that it has not been historically tested, which is not suitable for business to adopt if their clients do not trust a currency.

Additionally, the blockchain requires a lot of computing power and energy for it to ensure safe and valid transitions into the network. Taking the example of Bitcoin, which to put into perpective, in 2023 Bitcoin energy consumption was comparable to the power consumption of Ukraine (141.77 TWh) (https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption). This massive energy usages raises environment issues such as where the energy come from, is the energy used sustainable, is it green energy ? Which in most cases is not. Consequently, all this computing energy produces a lot of heat, and in big mining sites it raises issues for the local environment because most of massive mining sites are located in northen countries where the temperature is cold to prevent buying air conditioning systems.

Also, because cryptocurrencies are decentralized, certain governments might reject this idear of peer-to-peer as governments want to have control over their currency and have it centralized to moniter the currency.
