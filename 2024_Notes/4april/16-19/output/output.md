## 4 input, outputs in details

- barcode reader
    - used to identify
        - can be tracked
        - track badage
        - holds links to website
        - wifi SSID connector

- pen style code reader
    - convert the black and white bar into binary data
    - drag it consistently across the barcode
    - detects where the black and white
    
    - photo diode
        - receiving

- laser scanners
    - laser beam across a 
    - laser sweeps the barcode
    - read on different postion
    - uses a mirror to sweep across the barcode
        - beam to read the barcodes

- charge-coupled device (CCD)
    - read the barcode with a light sensor
        - reads all at once
    - photo diode

- camera-based readers
    - can read qr codes
    - 2D codes

### write a paragraph that outlies the different types of readers

- digital camera
    - light come in
    - filters
    - CMOSS sensor

- mirros
    - split into colors filters
        - blocks all light apart the color of the filter

- charge-couple device
    - CCD
    - uses 100x more power than CMOS

- CMOS
    - cheaper
    - lower resolution
    - regular usages

    CCD is more expensive , it uses much more power and is designed for professional uses. Whereas CMOS is cheaper, has lower resolution, designed for regular usages

- sensors made up of tiny sensors

![sensor](image-5.png)

- shades of grey
    - measuring the intensity of light

![colors](image-6.png)
- filter
    - capture more green
        - to look more natural
        - eye used to seeing green

    green is a more natural color, our eyes are more sensitive to green. With more green, photos look more natural

- ink stored in the Toner Hopper
    - dried powder ink
- create a bitmap image

- negatively charge the Print Drum
- laser will ingrave the bitmap
- drum rotates and picks up toner hopper like a magnet
    - drum is covered in ink
- drum will paint on the paper tray
- Paper tray is bonded by the toner with heat and pressure

- heated fuser
    - to bond the paper tray and the toner together by applying pressure and heat

- vectors
    - shapes
    - colors shades

- bitmap
    - images made out of pixel
