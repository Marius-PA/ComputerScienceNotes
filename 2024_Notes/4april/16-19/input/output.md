- ink stored in the Toner Hopper
    - dried powder ink
- create a bitmap image

- negatively charge the Print Drum
- laser will ingrave the bitmap
- drum rotates and picks up toner hopper like a magnet
    - drum is covered in ink
- drum will paint on the paper tray
- Paper tray is bonded by the toner with heat and pressure

- heated fuser
    - to bond the paper tray and the toner together by applying pressure and heat

- vectors
    - shapes
    - colors shades

- bitmap
    - images made out of pixel
