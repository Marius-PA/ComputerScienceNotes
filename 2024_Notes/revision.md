# Error Checking

### Wifi

- sending analog signal
    - needs to converts to binary
        - use ADC
            - Analog Digital Converter
- inteferance
- amplitude too weak
    - can cause an error

## error checking method

- Majority Voting
    - repeat a bit an odd amount of time

    each bit is being repeated an odd amount of time, when data is sent, the data received is much more reliable as there needs to be multiple bits being flipped for teh data to be corrupted. However, the data to be tripled if using 3 bits repeat.
