# Terminology

- difference between compilers and interpreter
    - compilers translates an high level language into object code

# object

- .o file
    - objet code format

## Compilers

- verify the entier program at once before you execute it
- translates an high level language into object code/machine code

## interpreter

- evaluate one line at a time
- intermidiate translation
    - may translate into bytecode
        - simplified/high level version of machine code

# Advantages

- compilers
    - catch errors before runtime

- interpreter
    - don't have to have the entier part of the pragram working
        - easier to debug
    - overhead
        - interpreters take a lot of memory to run

# assembler

- targeting assembly and compile it to machine code
 

---

- write an interpreter with arthimetic
- LALR parser 
    - look o,ne token ahead
        - from left to right
