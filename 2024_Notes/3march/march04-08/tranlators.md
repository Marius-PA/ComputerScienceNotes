# Translate Code

- C++, python
    - used to write programs

- From High level langauge TO machine code
    - by being compiled
        - High level language CANNOT be directly be executed, they need to be compiled

- Lexical analysis
- Syntax analysis
    - properly form
- Semantic analysis
    - matches
- Code generation
- Optimisation

- A tokenization

- Once token :
    - pass it to a passer

---

- Most errors
    - type related
    - index related

# Pros and Cons

- compilation
    - catches most errors at compilation time, NOT at run time
    - reduces the chance at runtime errors as it catches errors when translating/compiling

- interpreters
    - don't produce anything
    - run your code
    - another program needed to run your script
    - translates and execute each line one by one
    - Most use bytecode (not a programming language)
        - function defined = produced bytecode
