### how many different values can you represend with a given bits number of magnitude and sign

    (2^n-1 * 2)

## when you use sign and magnitude representation

- simplicity
- limited arithmetic
- legacy systems

- simplicity
- easy

# Truncation

- Precision control
- memory efficient
- performance improvement
- consistency
- error management

    when truncate : 0.0111 = 0.01 (2 decimal place), cutting off digits after a certain point without rounding
