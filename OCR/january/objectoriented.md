# objectives

    class, objects, methods, attributes, inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism

- psuedocode
    - class definition
    - instantie an object use its method
- draw inheritance diagram
- advantages of OOP

# Classes

- blueprint of an object

- car
    - wheel
    - engine
    - 

- properties
    - describe
- method
    - what it does

- can implement
    - array, fraction


# example

```pseudocode
class Dog
    private name
    private colour
    public procedure new (myName, myCoulour)
        name = myname
        colour = myColour
    endprocedure

    public procedure bark(barkTimes)
        for n = 1 to barktimes
```


# Public and Provate

- Attributes
    - private

- Methods
    - generally public

- ensures attributes cannot be changed except by executing a method

# Encaspulation and data hiding

- wraps attributes and methods in the class definitoon
    - hidden details from the user


# creating a new object

- instantiated
    - create the class

myDog1 = new Dog("Fido", "black")

# setters and getters

# Summuray

- class
template for an obkect which defines its attributes and methods

- object
instance of a class

- Constructor
method used to create a new object in the class

- instantiation


# Inheritance diagram

class Puppy inherits Dog
    private shoesChewed
    shoesChewed = 0
