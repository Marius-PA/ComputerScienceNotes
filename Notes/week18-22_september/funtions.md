# functions:

subroutines (procedures/functions)

Objectives:
- being familiar with subroutines and uses
- subroutine is a 'our of line' block of code
- explain advantages of using fuctions
- reducing down the code, less spaghetti code

---

Example

```python

def hello():
    print("Hello guys !")

hello() # (hello) function being called, avoid repetition
hello()

output:

Hello guys !
Hello guys !

```
Functions give us the ability to reduce the amount of code and being re-used:
## **it's like a big variable**
