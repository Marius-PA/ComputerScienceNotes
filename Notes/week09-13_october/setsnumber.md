# Natural Numbers

The set of a natural numbers consists of ***only positive whole numbers and zero***, denoted by ℕ, as shown below:

    ℕ = {0,1,2,3,4,...}

- Be familiar with the concept of a natural number and the set ℕ of a natural numbers (including zero)

# Peano axioms

Zero Starting point

There needs to be nothing to have something

    0 = {}
    1 = 0U{} = {0}
    2 = 1U{0} = {0,1}
    3 = 2U{0,1} = {0,1,2}

# Rational Numbers

ℚ is a set of numbers that can be written as fractions (ratios of integers). Since a number such as 7 can be written as 7/1, ***all intergers are rational numbers.***

    ℚ={ab:a,b∈ℤ;b≠0}

Be familiar with the concept of a rational number and the set ℚ of rational numbers, and that this set includes the integers

# irrational Numbers

An irrational number is

# Real numbers

The set of real numbers consists of both rational and irrational numbers, denoted by ℝ; in other words, it is the set of all 'possible real world quantities'.

# Ordinal Numbers

When objects are placed in order, ordinal numbers are used to indicate their position. For exemple, if we have {'a','b','c','d'}, then 'a' is first, 'b' is second, and so on.

- Ordinal numbers arepositions within a sequence, such as first or last

---

# Counting and Measurement

Natural numbers should be associated with counting; real numbers should be assiciated with measurement;

- natural numbers, *int* in Python, used to count cycles of while-llops, indexes in for-loops

- real numbers, *float* in Python, used for measurements, the sresult of a vector dot product calculation; an approximation.

# Extension

For an extension task, research the complex and imaginary numbers; they are used in fields including, but not limited to, Electrical Engineering and Quantum Computing.
