# Natural Numbers

The set of a natural numbers consists of ***only positive whole numbers and zero***, denoted by ℕ, as shown below:

    ℕ = {0,1,2,3,4,...}

- Be familiar with the concept of a natural number and the set ℕ of a natural numbers (including zero)

# Peano axioms

Zero Starting point

There needs to be nothing to have something

    0 = {}
    1 = 0U{} = {0}
    2 = 1U{0} = {0,1}
    3 = 2U{0,1} = {0,1,2}

# Rational Numbers

ℚ is a set of numbers that can be written as fractions (ratios of integers). Since a number such as 7 can be written as 7/1, ***all intergers are rational numbers.***

    ℚ={ab:a,b∈ℤ;q≠0}
