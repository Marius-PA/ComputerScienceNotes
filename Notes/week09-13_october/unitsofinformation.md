# Units of informations

# Learning Objectives

- Be able to define:
    - bits and bytes
    - know that the 2^n values can be represented with n bits

- Know:
    - quantities of bytes


# Bits and Bytes

Bit = the fundamental unit of information, represented as 0 and 1.

Byte = group of 8bits (it may vary)

    1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0 = 011111011

# States

    2^n = states, where n = bits

Example:

3 bits can be configured in 2^3 = 8 different ways:

2<sup>3</sup> = 8

    (Base 2) 000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111

    (base 10): 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7

# Bits

    [log(n) (base2)] = bits, where n = states
