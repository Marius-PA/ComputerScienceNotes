### How many more bytes does 4MiB have than 4MB ? 

(2<sup>20</sup> * 4) - (4 * 10<sup>6</sup>) = 194 304 Bytes

### How many nibbles (i.e a group of 4 bits) are there in 16KiB ?

Number of Nibbles = (Size in KiB) * 1000 (bytes/KiB) * 8 (bits/byte) / 4 (bits per nibble)

Number of Nibbles = 16 * 1000 * 8 / 4 = 32000 nibbles.

# Learning Ojectives

- Explain:
    - difference between:
        - unisgned
        - signed
        - fixed-point

- Calculate:
    - minimum and maximum values of all three binary forms

- Compare:
    - decimal to binary arithmetic for:
        - addition
        - multiplication

- Convert:
    - From binary to each binary form, and vice versa


***decimal means from 0 to 9***

***decimal POINTS mean when there is a point = 1.75***

# Binary recap

Bit = either 1 or 0

Byte = 8 bits

# Binary Forms

- AS cover ***3 binary forms***:
    - unisgned
    - signed
    - fixed-point

# Unsigned VS Signed

Unsigned binary = represent ***natural*** numbers

Signed binary = represent ***integers***

- they use different methods for representing the same values

# Unsigned Binary

Value of unsigned binary != calculate the sum of each bit, either 1 or 0
