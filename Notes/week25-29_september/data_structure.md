# Objectives

- be familar with the concept of a data structure
- Use 1 and 2 dimensional arrays in the design of solutions to simple problems

---

# Data structures

- Data types = char,real,integer and boolean
- built-in structured data types = strings, arrays and records

### record = a grouping of data types

---

# Large group of data

## An array of names

- Arrays give one name and referred to by an **index** as, for example, town(1), town(2), town(n)

- In Python = first element of the array is 0, such as town[0]:
    - In python, [] = only for **list**

---

# Trace tables

- shows a graphical way to show what an algorithm does

```python

name1 = "hi"
name2 = "hello"
names(1) = "Moe" # sequence of string
names(2) = "joe"

print(names[1,3])

```

# 2D arrays
