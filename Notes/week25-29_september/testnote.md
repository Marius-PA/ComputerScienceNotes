# number theory:

N = {1,2,3,....}
Z = {..., -1,0,1, ...}

rational numbers = represented by "Q"
Q = {a/b, a is a memeber of Z, b is a member of Z, b != 0}

# iteration

- Definite iteration = the number of iteration is known
- Indifinite iteration = the number of iteration depends upon a condition

# Global and local variables

***global variables*** = accessible to all parts of the program
***local variables*** = accessible only in subroutine they are declared

# Exception handling

***Exception handling*** = stops a runtime error (the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events when a computer program runs)

# For every test

- State ***three features*** of well written code that make it understandable without the need to include lots of comments:
    - Subrtoutine (function) = breakdown problems down
    - use of named constans
    - use of libraries
    - meaning / appropriate / suitable identifiers
