# Pixel

pixel is a smallest part of a image

***pixel is the smallest addressable part of an image***

a pixel is a representative bit of a coresponding colour

# Colour Depth

colour depht = 2

only 2 colours can be represented

colour depth = 2<sup>n

i.g = 2 bits can represent 4 colours

# Resolution

doesn't only mean width and height, BUT ALSO ppi

# Calculating bitmap file size

image file size (in bits) = width (in pixels) × height (in pixels) × colour depth

When an image has a width of 8 pixels and a height of 8 pixels, with a colour depth of 4 bits, the calculation is:

    Calculate total bits: 8 × 8 × 4 = 256 bits

# Metadata
