# Pixel

<strong>pixel is the smallest addressable unit of an image</strong>

a pixel is a representative bit of a coresponding colour

# Colour Depth

colour depht = 2

only 2 colours can be represented

colour depth = 2<sup>n

i.g = 2 bits can represent 4 colours

# Resolution

doesn't only mean width and height, BUT ALSO ppi

# Calculating bitmap file size

image file size (in bits) = width (in pixels) × height (in pixels) × colour depth

When an image has a width of 8 pixels and a height of 8 pixels, with a colour depth of 4 bits, the calculation is:

    Calculate total bits: 8 × 8 × 4 = 256 bits

# Metadata

Data about the data

- Image dimensions (e.g. width in pixels, height in pixels)
- File format
- Date and time of creation
- Geographical location of creation
- Details about the device used to create the - image
- Camera settings

# Image formats

- comparing file formats:
    - bitmaps (.bmp)
    - Graphic Interchange Format (.gif)
    - Portable Network Graphics (.png)
    - Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg)

# Learning objectives

- Explain:
    - how bitmaps are represented
        - resolution
        - colour depth
        - size in pixels

- calculate:
    - storage requirement for bitmapped images
    - bitmap image may also contain metadata

- Being familiar with typical metadata
