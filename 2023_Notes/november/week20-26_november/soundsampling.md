# Amplitude and frequency

Amplitude = height of the wave, from the middle to its highest point

time period = times passes between two wave peaks

Frequency = 1/time period ,sound's pitch

# Sampling Rate

sampling rate = frequency used to sample an analogue signal

Defined as the ***number of samples taken per second*** and is measured in Hertz

How many bits, what speed to get the best representation of a signal

# Resolution sampling

---

Q1. analogue is continuous, infinite presicion

digital is discrete, finite amount of steps (final precision)

Q2. sampling twice the speed amount that reaches the two highest points

Q3. 16-bit sample, 10 000 Hz, 20 seconds, kilobytes

16 x 10 000 x 20 / 8000 = 400
