# Amplitude and frequency

Amplitude = height of the wave, from the middle to its highest point

time period = times passes between two wave peaks

Frequency = 1/time period ,sound's pitch

# Sampling Rate

sampling rate = frequency used to sample an analogue signal

Defined as the ***number of samples taken per second*** and is measured in Hertz

How many bits, what speed to get the best representation of a signal

# Resolution sampling
