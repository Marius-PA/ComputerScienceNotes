    - the purpose of MIDI
    - advantages of using MIDI files for representing music

# frequency

higher frequency = higher pitch

lower frequency = lower pitch

1 Hz = sample ***per second***

# sample resolution

number of bits

# storage audio file

mono = storage in bits = sampling rate x seconds x sample resolution

stereo = x 2

# MIDI

MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a technical standard, includes hardware specifications, and a communication protocol

***MIDI files ARE NOT audio file***

MIDI = saving the description NOT THE SOUND, more like a sheet music

MIDI and MP3 are COMPLETLY different

## MIDI files

- countains :
    - Digital signals that specify
        - notation
        - pitch
        - intensity

- event messages = a list of ***instructions*** that countains:
    - duration and lenght of the note (how long it is played)
    - the picth and frequency
    - volume or loudness
    - the instrument

- PROGRAMMING MUSIC = CONFIG FILE of music

- advantages:
    - takes much less storage
    - performance data can be easily manipulated

- disadvantages:
    - Higher cost and requires skill to edit
    - doesn't sound realistic
