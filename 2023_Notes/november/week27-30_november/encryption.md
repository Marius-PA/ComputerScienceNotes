- Caesar cipher
    - encrypt a plaintext message
    - decrypt

# Cryptography

## Scytale Cipher 

tool used to perform a transposition cipher

# Security

- authenticity
    - proof that it is someone that sent it
    - not be able to take back what they sent

- confidentiality
    - restrict access unauthorised person
    - ensuring you only give access to the authorised persons

- data integrity
    - did the data was still the same after transmission
        - no interception

# Encryption

Encryption = ***the process converting a plaintext-encoded message into ciphertext, using a cipher algorithm with a key***

***obfustation of data*** = making a text not human readable

### Key terminology

- Cipher:
    - a process
    - an algorithm (or a set of multiple algorithms) used to convert between palaintext and cipher text

- plaintext:
    - unencrypted/decrypted message
    - human readable

- Ciphertext:
    - encrypted message
    - obfuscated

# Decryption

Decryption = ***process of converting a ciphertext-encoded message into plaintext using a cipher algorithm with a key to make it human readable***

unencryption = DOESN'T EXIST

## Keys

- keys:
    - public key
        - share between the sender and receiver
    - private key

## Symmetric Vs Asymmetric

Symmetric cipher = the same key is used for both encryption and decryption

Asymmetric cipher = uses different keys for encryption and decryption, public and private key

- public key = encryption
- private key = decryption

# Caesar Cipher

shifts the ordinal value of a character codes by the key value

exemple: key = 7

    AN EXAMPLE = TG XQTFIEX
