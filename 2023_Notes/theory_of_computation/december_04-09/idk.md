- Abstraction
    - remove unnecessary details

- Representational Abstraction
    - What remains when unnecessary detail has been removed

- Abstraction by Generalisation
    - group things in terms of a set of common characteristics

- Information Hiding
    - the process of limiting the user's access to certain features to prevent changes or modifications 
    - Cleaning up your interface.

- Procedural Abstraction
    - when we write code sections which are generalised by having variable parameters
    - breaking down into steps

- Functional Abstraction
    - functions being blackboxes
    - the implementation detail of the computational method is hidden
    - we don't need to understand how a function works to call it 
    - (e.g "print", there is no need to explain how it outputs thing to the command line), we don't need to understand the low level
    - python is using functional abstraction

- Problem Reduction
    - solve a smaller verison of the problem
        - heuristic
            - proceeding to a solution by trial and error or by rules that are only loosely defined.

- Zero-knowledge proof
    - when someone doesn't know something it can actually give knowledge
    - "I don't know", still giving information by process of elimination

# Problems

- Original problem
- subproblems
- detailed subproblems
