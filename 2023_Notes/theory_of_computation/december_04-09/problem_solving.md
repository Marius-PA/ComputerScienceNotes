Problem solving for a computer

- be able:
    - ***develop*** solutions to simple logic problems
    - ***check*** solutions to simple logic problems
    - to hand-trace algorithm
    - convert an algorithm from pseudocode into high level language program code
    - articulate how a program works, arguing for ots correctness, and its efficiency using a logical reasoning, test data and user feedback

## terminology

***algorithm = set/sequence of instructions design to solve a specific problem***

context = why we want to do certain things

- sequence:
    - algorithm
    - sequence of statement/instructions
        - expression
        - expression: does something
- assignment:
    - setting the value
    - assign variable, constants
- selection:
    - if,else
    - decision being made, what the program should do next after a question has been answered
- iteration:
    - definite, indefinite
    - for, while loops
    - a function that repeats a block of code in a specified order, often until a specific result occurs

definite iteration (for loop): already knows how many times it will loop

indefinite (while loop): does not terminate until it makes a certain condition

## Pseudocode

### in pseudo code, counting from 1 for indexs (counts from 0 in python)

- if pseudocode counting from 1:
    - -1 the index to count from 0 on python

# Finite state machines (FSMs)
