# Ascii and Unicode fundamentals Part 1

## Number encoding

unisgned, signed, fixed-point binary = represent numbers in the binary system

## Character Encoding

Binary = used to represent charachters

charachters are denoted by single quotation mark ''

String are denoted by double quotation ""

## Characters vs Numbers

decimal digit differ from binary value assigned to it

0 != '0'

## Character Code

A unique number that represents a character,
character code 65 represents the character 'A' in the ASCII and Unicode standards

## Ascii

a character encoding standard published in 1963, using 7 bit and only supporting English alphabet

## Internal Communication

Unicode was introduced in 1991 = international communication = implement all other languages = for not being forced to only using English for communication

# Unicode

Unicode = splits into blocks

blocks = set of related characters

unicode defines up to 32 bits

## Unicode Transformation Formats (UTF)

UTF is a variable-length character encoding standard = including UTF-8 (1 byte), UTF-16 (2 bytes), UTF-32 (4 bytes)

## Characters and Strings

Python DOES NOT support the character data type

A character is represented by a string that consists of only that character
